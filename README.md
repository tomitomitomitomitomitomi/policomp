this is my first attempt at building Stupid Software.
run the app using npm run dev.
it's composed of 2 views index and results
and a simple route that tracks information.
information is not persisted the "database" is on line 7 of the vote.ts file
index works for mobile and mobile only as of now, people drag whatever is in the middle to a section of the compass, that counts as casting a vote.
vote average is shown on the results page.
the idea is to have the results page cast so people can vote in "realtime" (actually the page polls every 5 sec) while you speak.
